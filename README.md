# ARIMA-HW
So, after running the ARIMA model on the temperature time series, the function picked a model that looks something like ARIMA(1,1,1). This just means it used one past value (AR part), it differenced the data once to make it more stable (the "1" in the middle), and it also used one past error (MA part) to improve the prediction. The model gave us some coefficient values, like how much past data or error affects the current values, and even included a tiny "drift," which kind of acts like a slow trend upward or downward in the data. Then it showed some scores like AIC and BIC, which are basically numbers that help tell us if the model is a good fit. Lower numbers are better, so we want those to be small.

After that, we checked the residuals, which are just the leftover patterns the model couldn’t explain. Ideally, we want these to look super random with no patterns or weird trends. The plots looked clean, and the Ljung-Box test had a high p-value, meaning the model did a solid job. If that test had a low p-value, we’d worry that the model missed something important. But in this case, everything looks pretty good, no red flags, and the model seems to capture the overall pattern of the temperature data well.
